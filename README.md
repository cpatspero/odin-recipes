# odin-recipes
I will be following along to the TOP project: RECIPES 
In this project I will apply all of the skills I learned in the foundations HTML course. 
The skills demonstrated will pertain to; adding links, adding folders, committing to github, using pictures, developing a deeper understanding of the different parts of HTML elements etc.
