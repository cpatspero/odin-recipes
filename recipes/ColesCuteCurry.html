    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a wonderfully easy (and wonderful tasting) curry dish that you can make in the comfort of your own home.</p>
    <p>You only need a few ingredients, and a couple of spices that you can find in any grocery store near you.</p>
    <p>Let's get cooking!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>  
      <li>2lb Chicken Thighs</li>
      <li>Low Fat Greek Yogurt</li>
      <li>Large Yellow Onion</li>
      <li>6-7 Garlic Cloves</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Garam Masala</li>    
      <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
      <li>Tumeric</li>
      <li>Cumin</li>
      <li>14oz Can Crushed Tomatoes</li>
      <li>400ml Can Coconut Milk</li>
      <li>Knob of Butter</li>
    </ul>  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>  
      <li>Marinate chicken thighs in greek yogurt, salt, pepper, garam masala and paprika for at least 1 hour. Preferably overnight.</li>
      <li>After marinating, cook chicken in a large pot with olive oil.</li>
      <li>While cooking, dice the onion and garlic.</li>
      <li>Remove chicken when 80% cooked and set aside. Do not discard the liquid that has accumulated.</li>
      <li>Add a splash of olive oil and a dash of salt to the same pot. 
      <li>Follow quickly with the diced onions.</li>
      <li>When the onions are mostly translucent, add in garlic. Add more salt now too. Fuck it. It's good for you.</li>
      <li>Once all the onion and garlic is nice and cooked down, add in all the spices. Don't bother measuring them out. Just coat the onion garlic mash evenly with everything. It's hard to ruin curry with too many spices.</li>
      <li>Add more salt.</li>
      <li>Pepper too.</li>
      <li>Fry for a minute or two until the spices absorb all liquid leaked out from sweating down the onions.</li>
      <li>Open your can of crushed tomatoes. Toss the whole thing in there. (No, not the can. Just the red stuff.)</li>
      <li>Fill the empty tomato can with water, about halfway, and toss that in too. (Again, just the can.)</li>
      <li>Stir on a high simmer for 20-25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the sweet bliss of having to clean up the splashing red ooze all over your stove.</li>
      <li>Open the can of coconut milk and add to the pot.</li>
      <li>Let simmer for another 15-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>clean.</li>
      <li>Right before you're about to flip out, add the chicken back in.</li>
      <li>Simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn off the element. Walk away. Take a pee. Listen to your favourite song. Then go back and either plate into bowls for 10 guests, or place into tupperware and freeze to eat every night for the next two weeks.</li>
      <li>Realize you forget to add the knob of butter and tell yourself, "It's okay. No butter means more health."</li>
      <li>Garnish with something green.</li>
      <li>Enjoy over rice, with naan bread, or use as pizza sauce. You sick, demented, genius.</li>
    </ol>
