    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great meal when you're short on time, but want to feel a touch bougie before heading out the door.</p>
    <p>Kick up your ramen with a few simple ingredients and only 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Let's get cooking!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Pack Ramen (your choice)</li>
        <li>3 large Eggs</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Green Onion</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Set a timer for 8 minutes and add in your first egg.</li>
        <li>At 7 minutes, add your second egg.</li>
        <li>At 6 minutes, add in your third, and final egg.</li>
        <li>Once the timer goes off, carefully move all 3 eggs to ice water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the ramen noodles to the already boiling water. Do not add the sauce pack.</li>
        <li>Choose a well-crafted glass bowl for the dish.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce packet to this bowl.</li> 
        <li>The one you will serve yourself in.</li>
        <li>Your dirty little pig bowl.</li>
        <li>Add mayo, sesame oil and soy sauce to the ramen packet. Just eyeball it to whatever taste and texture you desire.</li> 
        <li>Heavy mayo will be more viscous. Heavy sesame oil will be less viscous. Heavy soy sauce will be both less viscous and just kinda gross.</li>
        <li>Take a spoonful of the ramen water and add it to your mixture. This will help to combine all of the elements. Add the water little-by-little so that you can achieve the texture you're looking for.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles are cooked, strain well and add to your pig bowl. You little piggy, you. Mix thoroughly to coat with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Back to the eggs.</li> 
        <li>Peel all three eggs and cut them in half. Choose whichever egg has the best yolk for your ramen preference. Immediately discard the other 2.</li>
        <li>Place the chosen one gently atop the bed of ramen. Give it a tender goodnight kiss. "Everything is going to be okay."</li>
        <li>Finely chop up some green onion and sprinkle over your dish.</li>
        <li>Grab chopsticks (weeaboo) or a a fork (filthy infidel) and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
